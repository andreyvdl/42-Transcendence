## üõ†Ô∏è How to build for development?

First you will need Docker and Docker Compose,
[Python](https://www.python.org) 3.10+, Postgres and make.  
You will need a .env file and an Intra42 registred API.

```.env
DJANGO_DEBUG=True

SQL_DATABASE=your_database_name
SQL_USER=your_database_user
SQL_PASSWORD=your_database_password
SQL_HOST=your_database_hostname
SQL_PORT=your_database_port

INTRA_UID=your_intra_public_key
INTRA_SECRET=your_intra_secret_key
INTRA_REDIR="http://localhost:8000/auth/intra"
MY_IP=your_LAN_ip
```

After you have everything just run `make local`.
